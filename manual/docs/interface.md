# Interface

---

You can customize many interface settings.
Depending on your screen size, you might want to add or remove quick shortcuts for the lower left and bottom bar.

Note that if the left shortcuts can't fit on the screen, some of these shortcuts won't be displayed.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard is supported on iOS, you can hold âŒ˜ to display a list of shortcuts.

For Android, support is a bit experimental.
