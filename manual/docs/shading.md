# ![](./icons/sun.png) Shading

This menu controls the shading modes used by Nomad, lighting properties, and the environment light/matcap properties.

![](./images/shading_overview.png)



You can choose between several rendering modes:

| Mode                        | Meaning                    | Description                                                   |
| :-------------------------: | :------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------: |
| [Lit(PBR)](#pbr)            | Physically Based Rendering | Painting with metalness/roughness                             |
| [Matcap](#matcap)           | Material Capture           | Using during sculpting with lower gpu/cpu use than PBR        |
| [Unlit](#unlit)             | Surface Color              | Surface color only with no shading or lighting                |
| [Object Id](#objectid)      | Object ID                  | A random color per object, useful for painting applications.  |
| [Instance Id](#instanceid)  | Instance ID                  | A random color per instance, useful to identify shared meshes |

If you want to learn more about metalness and roughness, see the [Vertex Paint](painting.md) section.

### Face Group
Overlay facegroup colours. Facegroups are coloured selections of polygons that can be created with the [Face group](tools#facegroup) tool, and are made automatically with most of the primitives.

Some tools will automatically filter by facegroups when facegroups are visible.

### Show paint
Nomad can store color, roughness, metalness in the verticies of your sculpt. You can toggle the display of these properties globally with this checkbox.

Note that if you have both vertex properties and textures, and both are enabled, the values will be multiplied together.

### Show mask
Toggle the grayscale mask overlay of the [mask tools](tools#mask). When this is disabled, the mask is also disabled, useful for making quick changes without the mask, then you can enable it again and not lose your mask.

### Use Hide


### Use textures

Nomad allows for textures to be assigned to objects from the [material](material) menu. If textures are assigned they be toggled globally with this checkbox.







### PBR and lights overview
This manual won't dive into the details about Physically Based Rendering.

One important thing to keep in mind is that lighting and material are fully separated.
It means you can paint your object color, roughness and metalness while the lighting is handled independently.
It allows you to paint your object and then tweak the lighting later, without breaking the overall look of your model.

Lights are only available with [PBR mode](#pbr).
For performance reasons, you are limited to only 4 lights.

::: tip
You can load a glTF file with more than 4 lights in it and Nomad will keep all of them.
However it won't necessarily perform well.
:::

::: tip
You can fake many lights by making objects unlit/emissive, then enable global illumination in the [post process](postprocess) menu.

### Light types overview

Here are the type of lights currently supported:

| Mode                        | Description                                             | Can cast shadows                                       |
| :-------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
| [Directional](#directional) | Infinitely far away sun light                           | yes                                                    |
| [Environment](#environment) | A distant light that is matched to the environment  HDR | yes                                                    |
| [Spot](#spot)               | Cone shaped lights				                        | Yes                                                    |
| [Point](#point)             | Omni-directional point of light                         | Yes, but only through less robust screen-space shadows |

#### Directional
It emits light from infinitely far away, with a uniform intensity.
It's 3d position in the scene doesn't matter, only its orientation does.

You can attach this light to the camera, that way it has consistent lighting.  
For example you can use it to make a rim light (a strong light that emits from the back of your model, pointing towards the camera) that always lights the back of your model.

#### Environment light
Using a [environment hdr](#environment) works well for overall soft lighting, but if there is a strong sharp light visible in the HDR, the shadow created by it will be very soft, often not visible at all. Using a directional light in combination with the environment HDR can help, but it can be difficult to get them aligned.

This light does the work for you. The light will automatically be rotated to align with the brightest part of the HDR, then you can control its intensity and angle (shadow softness) separately. 

#### Spot
Spot light emits light in a single direction, restricted by a cone shape.

#### Point
Point light will emit light in every direction.  
At the moment, point light doesn't support shadows.

#### Shadows
The option `normal bias` can be used to reduce common shadow artifacts (acne/peter-panning).

The quality of the shadows depends on the size of the objects relative to the entire scene.  
If you have a big object in your scene that doesn't need to cast shadows (for example a big plane), make sure to disable shadow casting in its [material settings](material.md#cast-shadows).

## Lights

![](./images/shading_lights.png)

### ![](./icons/checked.png) Lights checkbox

Toggle all the direct lights in the scene.



### Add light

Add a light to the scene, to a maxiumum of 4. When a light is added, the light lister is displayed with buttons, and a light toolbar is added to the top of the viewport.

![](./images/shading_lights_icons.png)

* The text shows the name of the light and the brightness.
* The eye icon toggles visibility.
* The pencil icon allows you to rename the light.
* The trash icon will delete a light.
* The copy icon will duplicate a light. 
* The 3 dots icon will bring up a full light editor. Most of this functionality is also available from the toolbar that appears in the viewport. 

### ![](./icons/spotlight.png)  Icons

Toggle the display of light icons in the viewport

### Light toolbar
![](./images/shading_lights_toolbar.png) 

This toolbar will appear at the top of the viewport when a light is selected.

* Show will toggle the light visibility.
* Directional/Environment/Spot/Point will change the light type. Tap to cycle, or long press to see a menu.
* Intensity controls light strength, value can go above 1.0 for very intense lights, useful when used with Global Illumination in Post Process
* The color swatch when clicked will bring up a color selector. Nomad offers several ways to choose color. Kelvin control offers a natural way to select warm/cool lighting.
* Shadow will toggle shadows.
* Size sets the width of a light. Wider lights will cast soft shadows, soft lighting, and a softer highlight on objects.
* ... will bring up extra controls.

### Light extra controls

![](./images/shading_extra_controls.png) 

Note that some options are specific to certain light types.

* `Clone` will duplicate the light.
* `Recenter` will move the light back to the origin.
* `Delete` will delete the light.
* `Directional/Environment/Spot/Point` allow you to change the light type.
* The `colour swatch` when clicked will bring up a color selector. 
* `Intensity` controls light strength.
* `Attachment` (_directional only_) will set the light to be parented to the world, or to be parented to the camera. Eg if you use a directional light behind your character as a rim light, when attachment as camera is selected, rotating the camera will always have the light behind the character.
* `Angle` (_directional and environment only_) is the apparent size of the light, think of it as how big the sun appears in the sky. Bigger angles will cast softer shadows and wider highlights.
* `Softness` (_spotlight only_) controls the sharpness of the edge of the spotlight cone. 0 is a very sharp edge. 1 is very soft, with a gradient to the center of the light cone. In the viewport, the small blue dot on the spotlight cone can be used to set softness interactively.
* `Cone angle` (_spotlight only_) controls the spread angle of the spotlight. A small angle is a very thin beam of light, 170 is a very wide spread of light. In the viewport, the orange dot can be used to set the cone angle interactively.
* `Shadow` will toggle shadows for the current light.
* `Shadow map` and `screenspace` are different ways to calculate shadows, generally shadow map is more reliable.
* `Contact` adjusts how shadow are calculated. Shadows are a difficult problem in computer graphics, and can cause artifacts in rendering. More accurate shadows can be selected for the most important light in a scene, this control determines if the most important light is selected automatically by Nomad, or if the user selects.
* `Tolerance` if shadow artifacts are visible (either shadows don't appear to contact surfaces, or there's noise and patterns within shadows), adjusting tolerance can help fix those issues.


## Environment

![](./images/shading_environment.png)

Light in the real world comes from all directions; the blue of the sky, the green of the grass, the red of a building, all this light from the 'environment' can be simulated with an environment map. 

Nomad comes with several example environment maps for indoor and outdoor areas, with different tints and brightness levels. Try different maps to see which brings out the most detail in your sculpts.

Tap on the image to see the available environment maps. From that dialog choose 'Import...' to load your own. It's best to use High Dynamic Range (HDR) images, in the latlong or equirectangular format, as either .hdr or .exr files. [www.polyhaven.com](https://polyhaven.com/hdris) has a good collection of free environment maps to use, generally the 1k hdr maps are a good size and good quality.

### Exposure
Adjust the brightness of the environment map. Often the maps can be too bright when used with regular lights, turning the exposure down can help balance, especially when used with Global Illumination in the [Post Process](postprocess) settings.

### Rotation

Becaue environment maps capture light from all directions, you can rotate them to get the reflections and overall lighting to combine well with your sculpt.

### Attached to camera
Attach the environment to the camera.

It will force the lighting to be consistent, whcih can be useful during sculpting.


## ![](./icons/sphere_smooth.png) Matcap

![](./images/shading_matcap.png)

As the name suggests (MATerial CAPture), a matcap takes care of both the lighting and material information in a single image.
Since the material itself is already present in the matcap, roughness and metalness painting channel will be ignored.
The painting color will be multiplied against the matcap, meaning if you have a black/gray matcap, using white paint won't make it brighter.

Artists tend to favor this mode for sculpting purposes since they allow them to focus on the shape and geometry itself.

Tapping on the sphere will bring up an image browser. You can also add your own matcap, generally any photo, render, even a painting of a sphere that has been cropped tightly into a square can be used. Many matcap libraries are available online, a useful resource is the [nidorx matcap library](https://github.com/nidorx/matcaps).

### Use global Matcap

Usually artists will use a single matcap for the entire sculpt, but if this toggle is disabled, each object can have its own matcap. This can be used artistically to get striking results.

::: tip
Disable this option, and use an image of an eyeball for your characters eyes!
:::

### Rotation
A matcap is a specialised form of an environment map, so like an environment map, it can be rotated. You can also do this at any time in the viewport by dragging with 3 fingers left and right.



## ![](./icons/circle_fill.png) Unlit

This mode will only show the surface color. It can be useful for checking the surface color of your objects are what you expect, without being distracted by lights, shadows, reflecton, transparency. 

This mode can also be used for non-photoreal renders, achieving a flat, cartoony look.

## ![](./icons/cube.png) Object ID

All lighting and surface information is ignored, and each object is shaded with a unique flat color. If this is rendered alongside a PBR render, this can be used in a painting program to select by color, and thus be able to do color corrections on specific objects.

Note that these colors will also appear in the [Scene menu tree view](scene#tree-view).

### Randomise id

Generate a new set of random colors. 

## ![](./icons/link.png) Instance ID

Same as Object ID, but instances will have the same color. 

### Randomise id

Generate a new set of random colors.
