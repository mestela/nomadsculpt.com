# Getting Started

## Welcome to Nomad!

Nomad is a 3d sculpting app that works on many devices, but is optimised for tablets with a stylus, eg an Apple iPad and pencil, or a Samsung Galaxy Tab with stylus.

It is inspired by desktop sculpting apps like Zbrush and Blender, but with a focus on an easy to understand UI, without sacrificing on features. If you've used 3d sculpting apps before, Nomad will feel very familiar.

If this is your first time doing 3d sculpting, then it's good to know some basics.

Youtube now has a LOT of beginner video tutorials, here are some great links:

## Your first sculpt

When you first start Nomad you'll see a sphere on screen. Simply drag your stylus on the sphere to start sculpting. Symmetry is enabled by default to make sculpting easier.

To make the brush bigger or smaller, use the radius slider on the left.

![](./videos/gettingstarted_02.mp4)

To make the brush stronger or weaker, use the intensity slider on the left.

The default tool is the `Clay tool`, and it adds to the surface. To subtract from the surface, tap the `Sub` button on the left. To add to the surface, tap the Sub button again.

To smooth the surface, tap the `Smooth` button. To go back to regular sculpting, tap the Smooth button again.

To rotate around the model, drag in empty space outside the model.

To zoom, use the two finger zoom/pinch gesture.

To pan the camera, press 2 fingers on the screen and drag.

If you make a mistake, a 2 finger tap will undo, or use the undo button in the lower left.

## Add color

Nomad allows you to paint the surface of your sculpt. From the tool menu on the right, find the `Paint` tool, and click it. On the left toolbar a colored sphere will appear. Click it, this will bring up a color selector. Choose a color, and paint on your model.

To erase, tap the `Erase` button on the left toolbar, then erase on the surface. Tap the erase button again to get back into paint mode.

Using the clay brush in add/sub modes, smooth, paint, see if you can make a simple cartoon head:

## Other tools

The tool pallette has many tools to help with sculpting. So far you've used the clay brush (the default starting tool), smooth, and paint. Because smooth is used frequently, it has an extra shortcut in the left hand toolbar.

The tools in Nomad can do a wide variety of things, from sculpting related tools like move, crease, inflate, to tools like split and trim that are more like carpentry or metalwork tools. The [Tools](tools.md) page has more info.

See if you can use the move, crease, inflate, and smooth tools to add more detail to your head, change its shape:

Now that you know the basics of Nomad, lets look at the rest of the interface.

## Interface

![](./images/interface_overview.jpg)

* `Top menus` - The menus to access most of Nomads features. The top-left menus mainly cover scene and object features, the top-right menus are related to tools. On smaller screens these menus will collapse together to save space.
* `Stats` - Information about the scene, the current object, mask status, memory usage.
* `Nav Cube` - A helper to show what side of the sculpt you're looking at, as well as a shortcut to jump to different views. Tapping the cube will jump the view to the tapped side. Dragging the cube will rotate. Tap the small icons to the side of the cube to frame the current object, or reset to the default home view.
* `Toolbox` - Nomad's tools are available from this scrollable region.
* `Left toolbar` - Sliders for radius and intensity for most tools, context specific buttons for other tools, and shortcuts for symmetry, the tool alt/sub mode, masking, smoothing, the gizmo, and paint options.
* `Bottom toolbar` - Shortcuts for commonly used features, explained below.

::: tip Left handed?
You can mirror the placement and ordering of all the toolbars, see [Mirror top bar](#mirror-top-bar) and other related options.
